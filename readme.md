📘 Student Performance Analysis

A Data Analytics Case Study using Python, Seaborn & Statistical Testing

⭐ 1. Project Overview

This project analyzes academic performance of 1,000 students across Math, Reading, and Writing, to understand how demographics, test preparation, socio-economic factors, and parental education impact learning outcomes.

The study uses Python for:

Data cleaning

Feature engineering

Exploratory data analysis

Data visualization

Statistical testing (t-test)

⭐ 2. Dataset Summary

The dataset contains:

gender

race/ethnicity

parental level of education

lunch type (standard, free/reduced)

test preparation course (completed / none)

math score

reading score

writing score

Derived features created:

total score = math + reading + writing

average score = total score / 3

⭐ 3. Tools & Technologies Used

Python: pandas, numpy

Visualization: seaborn, matplotlib

Statistics: scipy.stats (t-test)

Environment: Jupyter Notebook

⭐ 4. Analysis Performed
✔ Data Loading & Cleaning

Loaded CSV with pandas

Checked dtypes, non-null counts

Computed summary statistics

No missing values found

Created total and average score columns

✔ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Gender distribution

Score distributions (math/reading/writing)

Boxplot: test preparation vs average score

Race × Gender vs Average Score

Parental education vs Average Score

Lunch type × Gender vs Average Score

✔ Statistical Test

Independent two-sample t-test to evaluate whether completing test preparation significantly increases average scores.

⭐ 5. Business Findings & Insights

Based entirely on the results and charts inside the notebook.

🔹 1. Test preparation significantly boosts performance

Students who completed the test preparation course score notably higher than those who didn’t.

p-value < 0.05 → statistically significant

Difference is real, not due to randomness

Business Impact:
Schools should invest in or require structured test preparation programs to improve academic outcomes.

🔹 2. Lunch type strongly correlates with performance

Students with standard lunch consistently outperform those with free/reduced lunch across genders.

Interpretation:
Lunch type is a strong proxy for socio-economic status (SES).

Business Impact:
Schools should target:

Supplementary coaching

Nutrition support

After-school programs
for socio-economically disadvantaged students.

🔹 3. Parental education level directly impacts student performance

Higher parental education (associate, bachelor’s, master’s) is linked to higher average scores.

Business Impact:
Policymakers should:

Develop family education workshops

Engage parents in literacy programs

Provide additional student mentoring for lower-education households

🔹 4. Race/Ethnicity shows performance variation

Your visualizations show:

Group E and Group C students perform highest

Group A generally underperforms

Within several groups, females outperform males

Business Impact:
Interventions should focus on:

Resource distribution

Curriculum support

Equity-focused academic programs

🔹 5. Gender performance patterns are subject-specific

Females score higher in reading and writing

Math scores are more balanced across genders

Business Impact:
Teachers can tailor:

Reading/writing encouragement for boys

Math confidence-building for girls
